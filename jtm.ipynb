There is a lot to unpack from that statement. \n\nYou are probably wondering: \"*What does 'runs code' even mean?*\" or \"*Why is Jupiter written like that? Are we talking about the planet?*\"\n\nThe answer is a bit complicated. In fact, it's easier to show you a Jupyter Notebook rather than explain what it is.\n\n\n### So, what does a Jupyter Notebook look like?\n\nJust like this. What you are looking at, right now &#x2013; on your computer screen, is a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook is \"*like a website*\" because you've opened it in your web browser (probably Chrome or Safari). And, the notebook \"*runs code*\" using source code blocks like the one below. \n\n\n### What is a \"Source Code Block\"?\n\nFor now, imagine that a source code block is a recipe, waiting to be cooked. In the same way that we bring a recipe into the kitchen, these source code blocks are brought into our Jupyter Notebook. This is where the magic happens.\n\nRemember when we asked: what is a Jupyter Notebook? Let's check the wikipedia page. \n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":":results:\n# Out [5]: \n\n\n# text/html\n#+BEGIN_EXPORT html\n\n        <iframe\n            width=\"100%\"\n            height=\"350\"\n            src=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen\n        ></iframe>\n        \n#+END_EXPORT\n:end:"}],"source":["from IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter', width='100%', height=350)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Maybe, you would prefer to watch a video instead:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":":results:\n# Out [15]: \n:end:"}],"source":["from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo('e52iCIJnFH8')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Maybe, you are bored already and want to listen to some soothing music?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":":results:\n# Out [18]: \n# text/plain\n<IPython.lib.display.Audio object>\n\n# text/html\n#+BEGIN_EXPORT html\n\n                <audio  controls=\"controls\" >\n                    <source src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Jazz%28We%27veGot%29.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\" />\n                    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n                </audio>\n              \n#+END_EXPORT\n:end:"}],"source":["from IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Jazz%28We%27veGot%29.ogg\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
